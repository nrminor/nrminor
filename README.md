### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a biologist who develops [research software](https://us-rse.org/about/what-is-an-rse/) with an emphasis on reproducibility, ease-of-use, and performance. Before my current position in [David H. O'Connor's group at University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://dho.pathology.wisc.edu/), I worked in bird population genomics and speciation at University of Wyoming and University of Minnesotaâ€”Twin Cities. I've also worked in collection and database management at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago and the Bell Museum of Natural History in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

My research interests include:
 - population and speciation genomics
 - evolutionary ecology
 - immunogenomics
 - scientific reproducibility
 - parallel computing
 - efficient data structures
 - low-carbon computing
 - statically-typed languages in science

My entry to programming, like many biologists, was R, and I still regularly do stats and data visualization with R. Nowadays, I do most of my scientific computing in Python, and for special applications, I'm a huge fan of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I also write a lot in domain-specific languages, most notably [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) to design pipelines, but also [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run software on different compute architectures, [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)-dialect markdown to render documents and presentations, [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) and some JavaScript/TypeScript for web applications, and [Just](https://just.systems/) to manage projects.

Collaboration is one the best parts of science. If you also develop research software or work on some of the same topics, I'd love to connect, bounce off ideas, and make the most of open-source software development together.
