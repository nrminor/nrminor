### Hi there 👋

I'm a biologist who develops [research software](https://us-rse.org/about/what-is-an-rse/) with an emphasis on reproducibility, performance, and ease-of-use. Before my current position in [David H. O'Connor's group at University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://dho.pathology.wisc.edu/), I worked in bird population genomics and speciation at University of Wyoming and University of Minnesota—Twin Cities. I've also worked in collection and database management at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago and the Bell Museum of Natural History in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

My research interests include:
 - population genomics
 - speciation and population divergence
 - evolutionary ecology
 - immunogenomics
 - disease ecology
 - scientific reproducibility
 - data visualization
 - simulations

My entry to programming, like many biologists, was R. Since then, I've graduated to Python and Julia. I'm also in the process of using projects to learn Go and Rust. To design pipelines and containerize software, I write a fair amount in Nextflow and Docker as well.

Collaboration is one the best parts of science. If you also develop research software or work on some of the same topics, I'd love to connect, bounce of ideas, and take advantage of open-source software development together.
