### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a biologist who develops [research software](https://us-rse.org/about/what-is-an-rse/) with an emphasis on reproducibility, ease-of-use, and performance. Before my current position in [David H. O'Connor's group at University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://dho.pathology.wisc.edu/), I worked in bird population genomics and speciation at University of Wyoming and at University of Minnesotaâ€”Twin Cities. I've also worked in natural history collection management at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago and the Bell Museum of Natural History in Saint Paul, Minnesota.

My research interests include:
 - population and speciation genomics
 - evolutionary ecology
 - immunogenomics
 - scientific reproducibility
 - data structures and algorithms
 - programming language design

My entry to programming, like many biologists, was R, and I still do stats and data visualization with R somewhat regularly. Nowadays, I do most of my scientific computing in Python, and for special applications, I'm a huge fan of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). I also use a number of domain-specific languages, most notably [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) to design pipelines, but also [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) markdown to render documents, websites, and presentations, and [Just](https://just.systems/) to manage projects. I also love trying out new languages, with [OCaml](https://ocaml.org/) and [Gleam](https://gleam.run/) being my latest fascinations.

Collaboration is one the best parts of science. If you also develop research software or work on some of the same topics, I'd love to connect, bounce off ideas, and make the most of open-source software development together.
